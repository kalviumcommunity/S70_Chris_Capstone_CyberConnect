#### Tech Stack :
For CyberConnect, you’ll need a full-stack tech stack that supports user authentication, data storage, real-time interactions, and security. Here’s a recommended tech stack:
#### Frontend (User Interface)
🔹 React.js – For building a dynamic, responsive UI.

 🔹 Vite – As a fast development build tool for React.
 
 🔹 Tailwind CSS – For modern, clean, and responsive styling.
 
 🔹 Redux (Optional) – If you need state management for user authentication, notifications, etc.

#### Backend (Server & API)
🔹 Node.js with Express.js – To handle server-side logic and API requests.

 🔹 JWT (JSON Web Token) – For user authentication and security.

#### Database (Data Storage)
🔹 MongoDB (with Mongoose) – For flexible, scalable NoSQL storage. Best for storing user posts, reports, and discussions.

 🔹 PostgreSQL or MySQL – If you prefer a relational database for structured data.

#### Authentication & Security
🔹 Firebase Authentication – Quick and secure login options (Google, email, etc.).

 🔹 bcrypt.js – For hashing user passwords securely.
 
 🔹 Helmet.js – For securing HTTP headers.
 
 🔹 Rate Limiting (Express Rate Limit) – To prevent brute force attacks.
 
 🔹 Captcha (Google reCAPTCHA) – To prevent spam and bot submissions.

#### Real-Time Features (Optional but Useful)
🔹 Socket.io – For real-time chat or alerts on new reports.
 🔹 WebSockets – If you need live updates on threat reports.
#### Hosting & Deployment
🔹 Frontend: Vercel, Netlify, or AWS S3 for React app hosting.

 🔹 Backend: Render, Railway, DigitalOcean, or AWS EC2 for hosting your Node.js server.
 
 🔹 Database: MongoDB Atlas (for MongoDB) or Supabase (for PostgreSQL).

#### Additional Tools & Integrations
🔹 Stripe or PayPal – If you plan to add premium features or donations.

 
 🔹 Email Notifications (Nodemailer, SendGrid) – To notify users about updates.
This stack ensures scalability, security, and a great user experience. Do you want me to tweak it based on your specific needs? 😊
